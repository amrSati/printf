# ALX Programme 0x11-printf Team Project
The project is creating a printf function in C, called \_printf. We wil try to optimize it to give the same functionality of the standard library printf function.

## **Outline**
The funcion writes output to the standard output stream, without using the standard library functions. 

\_printf() returns the total number of bytes printed to the stdout file descriptor (excluding the null byte at the end of strings).

If an error occurred, the function will return -1.

Function prototype: **int _printf(const char *format, ...);***

Further explanation will written while building the function...
